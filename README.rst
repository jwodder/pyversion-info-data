This repository contains the databases of CPython and PyPy version information
queried by the `pyversion-info <https://pypi.org/project/pyversion-info/>`_
Python library in order to provide up-to-date information about supported &
historic Python versions — namely, what versions exist/have been announced,
when they were or will be released, CPython series end-of-life dates, and
CPython versions corresponding to each PyPy release.

I promise 24-hour turnaround times for keeping the database up-to-date until I
am hit by a bus.
