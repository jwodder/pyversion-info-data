This repository contains a JSON file listing every Python version (excluding
prereleases), their release dates, and the end-of-life dates of version series.
It is queried by the `pyversion-info
<https://pypi.org/project/pyversion-info/>`_ Python library in order to provide
up-to-date information about supported & historic Python versions.

I promise 24-hour turnaround times for keeping the database up-to-date until I
am hit by a bus.
